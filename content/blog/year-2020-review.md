This only my second annual review on the blog but I have found introspection to be a great tool to clear the cluttered mind and help me get a direction. More often then not I am more grateful and elated after an introspection session. I have found that in general the bad memories/events seems to linger longer in my memory than the good ones; maybe its some kind of manifestation of the fight or flight response.  Introspection balances the good and the bad, doing it publicly is scary though. Goal is to write them every year ðŸ™‚ 

This year was quite special in many ways. Let's dive in.

## What I learned

 

- Data team structure and future of modern data stack: At SnapTravel, we went through a few team structures and designs for our data team. We were concerned with the correct composition, placement and workflow of the team so that it can be efficiently used as an asset to the company. The structure of a company's data team is an unsolved problem for many today. I think it is hard because the data stack itself is fairly nascent as compared to software stack; it is a lot more complex and demands a variety of skills. There were a lot of great resources published online about it this year.

- Power of building the right data platform and culture: Travel was hit the hardest from COVID-19. Having a modern data platform and advanced self-serve BI practice gave Snaptravel strategic agility. This allowed us to navigate the hard times with confidence and ease unlike other companies in the space. Data best practices and democratisation is a game-changer in today's era. Our CEO published a [post](https://medium.com/snaptravel/from-burning-millions-to-profitability-and-back-to-growth-in-60-days-b1702cd2631c) of some tips which below the surface require correct and contextual data to get it right.
- Data Engineering Consulting: Tried my hand at consulting/freelance projects on the side. It took quite a while to get my first project. But then it was a sudden flood of projects and opportunities. Personal network and Upwork was where I found the first two projects. I loved the feeling of being the expert in the room who was responsible to solve a specific problem. I didn't like that I didn't have as much influence or holistic understanding of the project as I was used.
- Drive: I am much more externally driven to do things than internally driven. That was disadvantageous when a lot of the external things got cancelled due to covid. I had been training hard for Dragon Boating Competition but due to covid, I ended up being a de-trained athlete. Something to work for future me is to get inspired from within and not run after shinny things/carrots.
- Professional Network: In the past two years, I have been actively working on surrounding myself with some of the smartest people in the Toronto area that are involved with data engineering and analytics. It has paid huge dividends to invest in this. Covid somehow made it easier to do this than before, any and everyone was a video call away. Some of the dividends I got were, sharing of utilities and best practices around how to build with DBT, hiring, speaking opportunities and recruiting.
- Airflow Summit 2020: I attended the first-ever Airflow Conference. I also got a chance to speak there which was awesome. Seeing the way Twitter, Pinterest and Paypal etc use Airflow was super inspiring and a great learning experience. A lot of the data engineering folks using airflow are working on solving similar problems; observability, metadata and lineage, scalable ML pipelines and testing.

## Big Life Events

### Covid

The pandemic was the highlight of the year. Going fully remote had made me rethink my workflows, routines etc. Working in a fast pace startup where are things are chaotic as it is, became harder when we suddenly went remote. Gradually, I got a hang of the new way and loved it. Now I have more time at my disposal which allows me to invest in myself outside work. I have been wanting to build a great mouseless development and internet browsing environment. I finally got a chance to do it and iteratively improve it. Covid threw off my plans of going to France for an international dragon boat regatta but made me pursue digital minimalism. I got to spend a lot more time in nature as that was the only outdoor activity allowed for most of the year.

## What went well

- **Public Speaking**: I did 4 talks this year which was a big improvement over 1 last year. I continue to believe it is important to share knowledge and experience in the topics that I am passionate about. Will do more of this in the coming years.
- **Networking:** Continued to build a network in the data space. DBT Slack was phenomenal help in this
- **Journaling:** Started journaling inspired by [Minimalist Journaling](https://medium.com/better-humans/draft-how-to-hack-your-brain-to-achieve-consistency-that-lasts-7f5fdc520d28). This had a domino effect on me. Some benefits were more awareness, more gratitude, habit building became easier and improved goal tracking.
- **Personal Website**: Launched a personal website ([nehiljain.com](https://nehiljain.com)) with the proper domain name this time. I had been lingering on it for quite some time.
- Got engaged ðŸ˜‡
- **Adventures**: Due to covid I ended up spending a lot of time outside in nature alone or with someone close to me. I went for some great camping experiences and hikes all year round.

## What I want to improve on

- **Streaming Data Pipelines:** At SnapTravel, I didn't get a chance to play much with stream processing. A goal for 2020 is to work on projects where I can deploy some Kafka, Flink or Spark stream processing to production.
- **Data Insights Delivery**: I want to get better at driving the last mile of data projects in organisations. That is the decision making after we have unearthed some data-driven insight. Conveying data stories and insights to relevant decision-makers is an important skill I want to become better at.
- **Ukelele**: I picked up the Ukelele in the holidays break. I would love to get good at playing finger-style this year
- **Writing**: I am really bad at writing but it has so many benefits to me. I want to continue making progress in how much I write and the quality of those pieces.
- **Digital minimalism:** After reading Cal Newport's book, I fell in love with the concept of digital minimalism and living digital life with purpose. I feel I just started the journey so next year will be telling on how I live an intentional digital life.

On to a great 2021!! ðŸŽ‰  ðŸš€  ðŸ“ˆ
