I have learnt a great deal about building data team and infrastructure from scratch for a fast moving business. Went from a single person doing both analytics and engineering to a team of 15. I have worked both with streaming and batch pipelines. Love using DBT for doing all the Transformations on the data to unlock the insights. 

I studied electronics engineering and math but ended up being responsible of data. I have been building systems and data teams ever since. 

I love startups, chaos and building things on top of data.
