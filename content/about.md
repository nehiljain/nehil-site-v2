Hello 🙏! I am Nehil, a Data Engineer based in Toronto. About to start my journey at McKinsey QuantumBlack. 

Before that, I’m helped Snaptravel build all things Data. I have built the Data team and infrastructure at Snaptravel from scratch and seen tremendous growth while playing various roles as the first data person in the organisation. My favourite data stack is Stitch, Snowplow, Airflow, DBT, Snowflake and Looker.

I love startups, chaos and building things on top of data. I get excited by the idea of delivering value through data, platform infrastructure and analytics. Best place to reach me is via email at jain.nehil@gmail.com
