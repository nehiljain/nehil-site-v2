Hello 🙏! I am Nehil, a Data Engineer based in Toronto. Currently, I’m helping to build the Data team Snaptravel. Before that, I co-founded Athletigen, a company that helps elite athletes with information from their DNA.

I have built the Data team and infrastructure at Snaptravel from scratch and seen tremendous growth while playing various roles as the first data person in the organisation. My favourite data stack is Stitch, Snowplow, Airflow, DBT, Snowflake and Looker.

I love startups, chaos and building things on top of data. I get excited by the idea of delivering value through data, platform infrastructure and analytics. I am open to advising or consulting work. Best place to reach me is via email at jain.nehil@gmail.com
